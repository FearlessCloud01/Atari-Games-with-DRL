# Atari-Games-with-DRL
This Repository contains files related to the project for showing how Deep Reinforcement Learning can be used to play Atari 2600 games. This repository is made for my AI&amp;SC course(CS3101/CS3131) project. Its sole purpose being to showcase this code. (And maybe get me at least some marks... (*￣∀￣))
